      use it. In our application there are different items are given according to variety in food. We have built a recommender system for the consumer based on the
      food items are frequently consumed and expiry. Therefore also helping the donor donate. Reducing food waste at retail, food service and household label can
      provide multifaceted benefits for both people and planet. There is a chatbot on the home page if user has any doubt how to order or how to donate or any query
